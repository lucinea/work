This innovative 10 piece cookware set will revolutionise the way you cook. Instead of chemicals or coatings, thousands of titanium based layers have been bonded directly to stainless steel. This results in a super-dense cooking surface that's stain-resistant, scratch-resistant, non-stick and dishwasher safe. Complete with a pure aluminium core for even heat distribution, they heat up 35% faster than other stainless steel pans. Designed and engineered to provide superior cooking performance and lasting beauty, the mirror polished finish will look as good as new for years to come.
